# Lexied
This project has been realized for the course "Interaction Design" organized by the VIA University College of Horsens, Denmark.

It is focused on the process methodologies behind the development of a reading device that can help people affected by dyslexia, by providing the correct pronunciation of a word through a hearing aid.

Everything has been created through the joint contribution of the following students:
- Giorgio Ajmone
- Marco De Luca
- Mattia Ottoborgo
- Barbara Furkert
- Nathan Bost

The repository provides the slides for the project presentation and the research paper for the methods discussion.
